# Sentiment Analysis REST API with FastAPI & Docker

This project builds, trains, and deploys a sentiment analysis model on the IMDb dataset using FastAPI and Docker. It exposes a REST API for making predictions and is ready for integration into CI/CD workflows and cloud deployments.

## Components Overview

| Component        |  Purpose                                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset	         |  IMDb movie reviews (binary sentiment classification)                | 
| ML Pipeline	     |  Data preprocessing + Logistic Regression using scikit-learn         |       
| REST API	       |  FastAPI to serve the model and accept POST requests                 |
| Containerization |  Docker to encapsulate dependencies and deployment                   |         
| Model Versioning |  MLflow to log models, parameters, and metrics per run               | 
| CI/CD	           |  GitHub Actions to automate training, testing, and deployment steps  |
